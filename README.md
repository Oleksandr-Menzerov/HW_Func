# HW_Func

As an input you have class User

public class User

        {

                public string Name { get; set; }

                public string Gender { get; set; }

                public int Age { get; set; }
        
        }


Create a new List of users and initialize it with data, like, new User { Age = 19, Name = "Sam", Gender = "M" }

To Do:

Use Func;

Implement filtering method of this List (list should be as a parameter in method) which will do some manipulation with a List and return already filtered List with Users.

The filtration function should be as an argument;
